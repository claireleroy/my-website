I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [CREST](http://crest.science/) - [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) ([IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)) working under the supervision of [Pierre Boyer](https://pierrecboyer.com/) and [Antoine Bozio](http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/bozio-antoine/en/). My research interests are in public economics and applied microeconomics. I'm specifically interested in the implication of information frictions and complexity for public policies design.
